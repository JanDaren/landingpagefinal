			Right before college, an awful thing happened.<sup>1</sup>
			Daren’s mother got diagnosed with Stage 3C Ovarian Cancer.<sup>2</sup> It has become the darkest and lowest point of his life.<sup>3</sup> 
			He did not know what to do.<sup>4</sup> She is her mother and she’s the only one he depends on.<sup>5</sup> 
			He and his family had a lot of struggles during these times.<sup>6</sup>
			Her mother had to undergo chemotherapy in another city because it is not available in Daet.<sup>7</sup> 
			Her mother was an independent and brave woman, however, cancer is not really a battle.<sup>8</sup> 
			There’s no win or lose in this illness, only survival, struggles, and suffering.<sup>9</sup>
			On the 21st Day of September 2021, his mother passed away.<sup>10</sup> 
			The pain and agony she experienced have come to an end for good.<sup>11</sup>
			It was a depressing day for his family and she will not be forgotten.<sup>12</sup> <br><br>
			
			He never expects to be here in Manila and study at the University of the East.<sup>13</sup> 
			His uncle helps him with his tuition and lets him enroll in the institution.<sup>14</sup> 
			Daren took the computer science course he always dreamed of, and got in.<sup>15</sup> 
			In 1st year, he achieved the college scholarship granted by the institution.<sup>16</sup> 
			Today he is still pursuing his dreams to become a better person, a well-known programmer, and to make her mother proud.<sup>17</sup> <br><br>
			
			We do not know what might happen in the future, just like we do not know where might a person go when they die.<sup>18</sup> 
			I always thought that living is pointless because we all are going to die someday, but turns out, it’s the bright side.<sup>19</sup> 
			Might as well live a life for the world to be remembered.<sup>20</sup> We are all going to die someday!<sup>21</sup>
